# Spam-Comment-Detection-using-ML
Detecting spam comments is the task of text classification in Machine Learning. Spam comments detection means classifying comments as spam or not spam. As this problem is a problem of binary classification, I used the Bernoulli Naive Bayes algorithm to train the model. Lastly I've used Streamlit to create a web application of the model.
